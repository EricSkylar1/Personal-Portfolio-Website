# 🧑‍💻 Eric Skylar — Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to showcase my work, projects, and technical skills as a full stack developer. This project primarily focuses on front-end development, serving both to improve and highlight my skills in that area.

# Deployment & CI/CD

This project is deployed automatically using GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). Whenever changes are merged into the main branch, the workflow runs automated checks like linting and testing to ensure code quality.

After passing these checks, the updated site is automatically deployed to Vercel, providing a seamless and fast deployment process. This setup ensures that the live site is always up-to-date with the latest stable code without manual intervention.
