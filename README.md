# 🧑‍💻 Eric Skylar — Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with **Next.js 14**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to showcase my work, projects, and technical skills as a full stack developer. This project primarily focuses on front-end development, serving both to improve and highlight my skills in that area.
